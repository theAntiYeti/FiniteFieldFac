# Information/Motivation
In algebra (including number theory and algebraic geometry) we often care about finite fields of the form F_p^n = GF(p^n).
The motivation is to be able to factor a (monic) polynomial in GF(p^n)[x] into irreducible factors.

Polynomial.py, finite_field.py are a prototype and factor only over GF(p) for prime p.

Fields.py is the current (work in progress) implementation.
